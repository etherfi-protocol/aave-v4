# ether.fi Cash Aave V4 Instance on OP Mainnet - Launch Specification

> Status: PRE-DEPLOYMENT. All instance and payload addresses below are PREDICTED from a full fork
> simulation run as the launch deployer (CREATE2, reproduce-or-revert). The AaveOracle and Cash
> Spoke additionally require the deployer to start at nonce 3 with no interleaved transactions.
> To be confirmed against the deployment report. Spoke implementation: EtherFiSpokeInstance
> (borrow gated to Cash Safes). LiquidationLogic: the addresses below were simulated with a
> self-deployed library at 0x818E84198224535FAeaEc1b583d3Ff6b812A5AF3; per review, the deployment
> will instead link the canonical library 0x88dF535473C5adf1f57789734A05E555F7Deb8DB (via
> FOUNDRY_LIBRARIES) once it is available on OP Mainnet — the spoke implementation and payload
> addresses will be re-pinned once, in the bundled canonical-library + compiler-profile pass,
> from a single agreed build procedure.

## Summary

Two-phase launch of the ether.fi Cash Aave V4 whitelabel instance on OP Mainnet, mirroring the Aave V4 Avalanche activation (proposal 504). Phase 1 (launch payload) configures everything DORMANT: lists 19 assets on the Hub, registers the Cash Spoke with per-asset caps (active = false), lists the reserves with their risk parameters, sets the Spoke liquidation configuration, and wires the operator roles. After on-chain verification of the configured state, phase 2 (activation payload) enumerates and activates every (asset, spoke) pair. Both phases are executed by the Owner Safe via delegatecall Safe transactions.

## Administration

| Role                                | Holder                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instance owner / payload executor   | Owner Safe 0x082B85ED50F1cd120C597EF860ece712e54CE844                    |
| Caps + dynamic risk config operator | Operator Safe (Nonce Capital) 0x23c30c38d73a0D1609ffAAe47aA7d6D1a3e46f03 |

Operator roles carved out by the payload: HUB_CAPS_OPERATOR_ROLE (201) for updateSpokeCaps/updateSpokeAddCap/updateSpokeDrawCap on the HubConfigurator, and SPOKE_RISK_OPERATOR_ROLE (401) for addDynamicReserveConfig/updateDynamicReserveConfig on the SpokeConfigurator. Both roles are also granted to the Owner Safe.
